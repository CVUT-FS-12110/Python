## Please go to your course:


### [E375004 - Python for Scientific Computations and Control](course-E375004.md)

## Prerequisites

### Installing

To succesfully clone this repository to your computer and use it, git and python interpreter will be needed.
Git can be downloaded here [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
You can download lates version from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) or use [anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/). Anyway install python 3.5 or higher.
Once you have downloaded and successfully installed those tools, you can clone this repository by terminal command:
```
git clone https://github.com/CVUT-FS-12110/Python-for-scientific-computation-and-control.git
```
If you are experiencing python for the first time, you can skip installing virtual enviroment, however we highly recommend that by terminal command:
```
python -m pip install virtualenv
```
or if you are using ubuntu, python will be propably reserved for python 2.7 so you need to use correct alias (usually python3 or py3):
```
python3 -m pip install virtualenv
```
