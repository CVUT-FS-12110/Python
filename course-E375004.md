## Codenames: E375004, 2375004

1. week - **Python Basics 1** - installation, IDEs, data types

   - [lecture + lab](courses/intro.md)
   - task: NO TASK this week, however make sure your Interpreter + IDE is working and you know how to operate it 
   - responsible person: matous.cejnek@fs.cvut.cz

2. **Python Basics 2** - for, while, if, functions

   - study [Lecture](courses/Basics-program_flow_and_functions.ipynb)
   - task: [Lab task 1](tasks/EN_Ceasar_cipher_encryption.ipynb)
   - responsible person: matous.cejnek@fs.cvut.cz
   
1. **Python Basics 3** - functions, classes

   - study any introduction to Python classes, for example: [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp) (easy to understand) or [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html) (more detailed)
   - study [Lecture](courses/Basics-functions_and_classes.ipynb)
   - task [Lab task 2](tasks/EN_game_simulation-rock_scissors_paper.ipynb)
   - responsible person: matous.cejnek@fs.cvut.cz
   
1. **Game like simulations** - Pygame

   - study te following example:[Lecture](courses/pygame_bouncy_balls.py)
        - you cannot run in jupyter - use console or any IDE
        - you need `pygame` - it can be installed via `pip`
        - the example is quite complex, but it consists only from concepts you already know. Thus you should understand it pretty easily.
  
   - task: [Lab task 3](tasks/EN_poker_test.ipynb)

1. **Html parsing, webscraping and server aplications** 

   - You will need following libraries (all instalable via pip):
     Beautifulsoup, requests.

   - What you should know before (general knowledge / internet basics):
        - [HTTP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)         
        - [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)
        - [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
   
     You need only basic knowledge of these (elementary/high school level).

   - Lecture materials:
        - [Simple http server](courses/http-simple_server.py),
          in case of need use additional external resources (optional):
          [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFNZ6kdBgO0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFNZ6kdBgO0)
        - [Python http requests](courses/http-requests.ipynb),
          the best additional resources is this external documentation:
          [https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
        - [HTML and JSON parsing](courses/parsing-html_json.ipynb) (you do not need to understand it fully, focus on work with JSON)
   
   - task: [Lab task 4](tasks/EN_ISS_location_logger.ipynb)

   - responsible person: matous.cejnek@fs.cvut.cz

1. **Flask applications (with jinja and WTForms)**

   - You will need following libraries (all instalable via pip):
     flask, WTForms

   - What you should know before (general knowledge / internet basics):
         - all the things from previous lecture (requests, simple http server, ...)
         - [HTML syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) - just basics
   
   - lecture and task: [lecture and task 5](courses/E3575004/flask/flask.md)
