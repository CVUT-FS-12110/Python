# Python introduction

## This (git) repository

We use git because it is the best way how to provide source-codes, notebooks and other stuff related to programming.
We strongly recommend you to study and learn how to use git effectively - also for the other courses.
You can use any tutorial (google, youtube) on the internet to learn how to use it.

To successfully clone this repository to your computer and use it, git will be needed.
Git can be downloaded here [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

If you do not want to use and install git, you can download this repository (or the new files) every week as a zip file.

## Python

You can download latest version from [python.org](https://www.python.org/). Aim for python 3.5 or higher.
After that install [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) - it will help you to install additional packages in a quite not painfull way.
Finally install IDE of your choice. If case you suffer with a lack of choice, go for [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

Alternatively you can use pre-installed Python with IDE and packages in bundle called [anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/).
This approach is much simpler, however it has some other drawbacks.

All steps above are insanely well documented in the Internet. Feel no shame to use google or youtube as your first resort of help.

## First steps

In case you have no previous knowledge of Python, please study [this page](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datatypes.asp) and replicate the examples there in your IDE.
For more detail explanation, you can see also [for example this page](https://realpython.com/python-data-types/).
